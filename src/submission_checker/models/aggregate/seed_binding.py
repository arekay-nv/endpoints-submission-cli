"""Seed binding — §4.6 seed rotation, checked across one Pareto curve.

§9.1's "Seed-set validity" row makes this a property of the whole submission, not of
one file: "every point must record the same seed set, and that set must have been
published for ``target_cohort`` or one of the three immediately preceding cohorts."
The first half is checkable today; the second is not, because the published registry
carries no cohort keys yet — see :attr:`SeedBinding.adoption_checkable`.
